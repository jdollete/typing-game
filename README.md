## Description
L-Type is a javascript game that allows users to practice and improve their typing speed and accuracy through a fun and competitive game.

## MVP
- A playable javascript game where words are falling and the player has to type in the words before they hit the "lava" to gain points. If a word hits the "lava" the player loses a life.
- Players can create an account and save their game statistics, such as:
  - High Score
  - Type Speed (in words per minute)
  - Accuracy (as a percentage)

## Extra Features (future development)
- Add varying difficulty levels
- Incorporate bonus features or power ups that the user can use:
  - Extra lives
  - A "bomb" that will clear the screen
- Create different "badges" for players to gain when they achieve a certain high score or have played a certain amount of games
- Have a multiplayer function where two or more players can play against each other simultaneously
